# Install for C++ (optional)

Manual C++ backend build (for testing/development):

If you want to build or test the C++ backend (`scistree`) independently, you can navigate to the `src` directory and compile it using `make`:
```bash
cd src
make
# You can then test it directly, e.g., ./scistree example_input.txt
```

This step is not required for the Python package installation if using `pip install .` as described above. See more details below.
